                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>{{ config('app.name') }} was founded with a simple but powerful idea - that international trade should be accessible, efficient, and transparent for everyone. The founder of {{ config('app.name') }}, has built a career rooted in solving real-world problems. With years of experience spanning logistics, compliance, and international trade, he developed a deep understanding of how challenging cross-border shipping can be. He saw firsthand how businesses from startups to established enterprises struggled to coordinate freight, access dependable service providers, get clear pricing, and manage legal or financial support. The process was often disjointed, time-consuming, and lacked transparency. That insight became the driving force behind {{ config('app.name') }}.</p>
