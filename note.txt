Tooltip resetting in admin users list

You can try by navigating to the /ome folder from SSH.

Clone your GitHub repo into the /ome folder
git clone < https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git > .
(Don't forget the dot (.) at the end â€” this clones into the current folder, not a subfolder.)

If you already cloned it before, and just want to pull updates:
git pull origin main

Replace main with your actual branch name if it's different.

After pulling, use:
ls -lah

To see your deployed files inside the ome folder.

Since this falls outside our standard support scope, it would require a developer to examine it in depth.

I recommend reaching out to your developer for further investigation.
